# Description
Some additions to the ~~Winter Drop~~ Garden Awakens. Mojang added some new stuff to the game. And I had some time to make this datapack.

## Resin Items
I don't why these items exist... But why not. All of these items are unbreakable.
- All resin items can be crafted from Resin Bricks.
- Resin tools have a bit less mining efficiency than iron and can only mine blocks that are wooden tools can

## Creaking Heart Chestplate
- Can be crafted from 3 Creaking Hearts and 5 Pale Oak Wood blocks
- When you put it on it activates and can't be taken off. Only destroyed or... if you die, and it's not a good solution in Hardcore mode.
- When mob or player dies wearing it, chestplate disappears and summons Creaking which can exist without Creaking Heart block. So this Creaking won't disappear, and you can use it for for redstone mechanisms. And you can kill it.
- Doesn't work on Peaceful difficulty
